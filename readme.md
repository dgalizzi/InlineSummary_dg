# InLine Summaries — a SillyTavern Extension

## AI Disclaimer
The code for this extension was AI-generated, then manually edited and refactored so the final result is around 70% AI.<br>
I'm a C++ programmer, and this is my first time touching JavaScript, hence the vibecoding.<br>

## What does it do?
This is a simple Summary/Memory extension. It allows you to select a range of messages in chat and summarise them using an LLM or manually. It then replaces the selected range with a summary message.<br>
The original messages are stored away and hidden, but can be restored at any time.<br>

## Usage
Select a **Start** and an **End** message using the two Message Action buttons.<br>
Then the options for **AI Summary**, **Manual Summary**, and **Clear Range** will appear.<br>
Click the **AI Summary** button and wait for the AI to finish generating.

## How does it work?
When a range is selected, the extension creates a new empty summary message and inserts it into the chat.<br>
The selected messages are stored in the `extra` data field of the new summary message.<br>
A summary prompt is generated by taking the main summary prompt and adding a specified number of earlier messages for context (or the entire history if the setting is `-1`). The context is wrapped with Start/End markers as defined in the settings.<br>
A mid-prompt is appended (also defined in the settings).<br>
The messages to be summarised are then added, also wrapped in Start/End markers.<br>
A end-prompt is appended (also defined in the settings).<br>
This complete prompt is sent to the LLM using the current connection profile or a specific profile if the option is enabled.<br>
Once the LLM is done, the contents of the summary message are replaced with the response. The chat is saved and refreshed.<br>
When the **Restore** button is pressed, the summary message is deleted and the original messages are reinserted into the chat.<br>

## FAQ

_**Can I edit the summary?**_<br>
Yes! They behave like any other message.

_**Can summary messages be summarised?**_<br>
Yes. Nested summaries are supported. When summarising a summary message, the summary text will be used, **not** the original messages

_**What happens during chat exports?**_<br>
If exported as JSON, the original messages will be in the file.<br>
When exported as plain text, only the summary messages will be exported.

_**Are swipes supported on summary messages?**_<br>
No. It shouldn’t break, but swipes will behave like regular message swipes without any awareness of the summary or the original messages attached to it.

_**Is it compatible with extension X?**_<br>
No idea. This extension directly manipulates chat and stores/restores messages without altering them. As long as other extensions are okay with that, it *should* be compatible — but no promises.

_**Can I select a specific Connection Profile/Chat Completion Preset for the summary?**_<br>
Yes. Since v1.0.2<br>
⚠ Warning: Any unsaved changes to `Connection Profile` or `Chat Completion Preset` or `AI Reponse Template` will be lost during profile change.

_**Has anyone actually asked these questions?**_<br>
Yes, the Connection Profile one.

## Known Incompatibilities

_**Chat Style - Document**_<br>
This specific style hides the Message Actions buttons from older messages, which also removes the buttons added by this extension. Bubbles and Flat styles do work.

## Changelog

#### v1.0.3
Chat will now attempt to scroll after reload to the summary message or the restored messages. (Note, can sometimes be unreliable as reloading chat triggers a scroll to the bottom and I'm tryingto scroll up, but should be better than nothing)
Added some protections against double-registering event handlers during hot reloads based on ArtemDMI fork.

#### v1.0.2
Added end prompt option, which is inserted after the content to summarise. (For models that have options like `/nothink`)
Added option to specify a connection profile.
Added option to specify a chat completion preset.
Fixed an issue where reasoning models could get stuck if the token limit was unable to fit the reasoning content.

#### v1.0.1
Added option to limit response length.
